Project Description:

This is a command line application. We are using node.JS to run our JavaScript file in the terminal as opposed to in the browser. We are asking a series of questions in the terminal and then storing the answers. We are doing this by using the inquirer that we downloaded, and using its prompt function. We use a .then function to take the answers from the prompts, and then put them into a generateHTML function. We take this generated HTML code and set it equal to a const. We then use the writeFile method that we installed with “fs” to create a new page called “index.html”, and we print the html code on this new page, also using the writeFile method. There is also a css file that has been created, that will style what is printed on the HTML page, and help it look more professional.

User Instructions:

In order to use this application, you need package.json, and package-lock.json. You need to be able to use inquirer, as well as fs, in order to use the prompts, the .then function, and the writeFile function.

Usage Information:

In order to use this application, you need to open the code from GitHub in VS code and then open up the index.js file in the integrated terminal. You will then run node index to run the javascript file. You will then be prompted with a series of questions that will ask you for the information that you need to build a read me file. When you answer these questions, your responses will be formatted and printed out on a newly generated HTML page.

How to Contribute:

In order to contribute to this page, you need to have permission from the repository owner. It is publicly viewable, but changes have to be from users that have been granted permission to make edits on the page.

Testing the application:

In order to test this application, download node.js if you have not already. Use NMP (node package manager), to install everything that you will need to complete the project.(inquirer, fs, etc.) Use the integrated terminal to run the index.js file, using the node index command. Answer all of the questions that you are prompted. Upon answering and submitting your answer to the final question, an HTML page named “index.html” will be automatically generated. Open this file in the live server, and your README page will be ready!
